[] Application UI adheres to Phase I: Code Cleanup of the CodeWorks Design Doc

[] Stretch Goals:
[] Likes have a popover showing the profiles who liked them
[] If you have not already done so include both the Users and the Posts in the search results
[] Use timeago.js or luxon.js to format the post time in the '2h' or '4d' format
[] Home and Search Results pages can use filter to only show alumni or non-alumni (graduated)
[] Once the project is graded, write the server yourself so you can deploy it as a full app!
[] Once graded create your own ads to show off your own projects that can be clicked to link to those projects
